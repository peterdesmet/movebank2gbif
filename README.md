# Movebank2GBIF

A proof of concept to make public Movebank data available on GBIF.

## Rationale

The animal tracking research community uses [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) as the central hub and repository for their data. Tracking data supporting a study can be deposited in the [Movebank data repository](https://www.movebank.org/node/15294): these data are public (under a CC0 license), formatted using a common data model, documented with metadata, and referencable via a DOI (via DataCite). In this repository, we want to create a proof of concept in which these data and metadata are reformatted as Darwin Core Archives and registered with GBIF, making these datasets available through the GBIF [website](http://www.gbif.org) and [services](http://www.gbif.org/developer/summary). This proof of concept is based on https://github.com/peterdesmet/ideas/issues/4
